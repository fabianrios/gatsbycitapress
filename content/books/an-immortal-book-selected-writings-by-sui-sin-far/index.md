Few realize that she wrote even more stories set in Gilded Age Manhattan. Indeed, Wharton summoned up the lost world of her childhood almost compulsively as an adult, long after she resettled as an expatriate in France. Edith Newbold Jones was born in 1862 into a grand New York family related to the Astors and Van Rensselaers. As a novelist, she was a late bloomer. She wrote a number of poems and stories during her itinerant childhood in the U.S. and Europe, but her work was sidelined by her society debut at age seventeen and, a few years later, a long and miserable marriage with a Boston Brahmin named Teddy Wharton. In her thirties, she started writing books about travel and interior decoration and finally published her first novel at age forty, in 1902. That opened the floodgates to dozens of short stories and novels, which she produced year after year until her death in 1937 in France. (She moved there in 1907, divorced Teddy in 1913, and barely set foot in America after the Great War). Some of her most famous fictional recreations of Gilded Age society were thus contrived both several decades later and a continent away. She revisited that world from many different angles: biting social critique, rose-tinted nostalgia, and, in the case of The Old Maid, a qualified appreciation of certain lost values, and certain ways of carrying oneself in the world.
